__NAME__,

I set up a new MySQL server for HW3.

You can access it by entering "mysql-db.tomchik.net" into the Server field at http://mysql.csi410.tomchik.net/index.php.

Your temporary password is '__PASSWD__'.  Make sure to change it ASAP. You can use the following statement in the web app's SQL box:

SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('<your new password here>');

Passwords must be 8 characters in length. 
===== DO NOT REUSE PASSWORDS TO IMPORTANT ACCOUNTS =====


You will find a database already created that is named after your NetID, '__NETID__'. You can CREATE and DROP tables, indices, views, and triggers in that database. I have granted as many permissions to you as possible. Just remember, "With great power comes great responsibility."


If you have any questions, or notice any problems, do not hesitate to email me.

Thanks.
Paul
